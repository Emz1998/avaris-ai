      "Build XGBoost ML model trained on NBA Stats API data for game outcome predictions",
      "Launch ad-supported blog with daily predictions in SEO-optimized article format",
      "Display transparent performance dashboard showing win rate, ROI, and historical results",
      "Automate daily prediction pipeline using scheduled jobs for fresh picks each morning",
      "Transition to subscription model once 55%+ win rate threshold is achieved",
      "Develop desktop prediction bot application for premium programmatic access",
      "Provide tiered service for casual bettors (free moneyline) and serious bettors (premium spreads/totals)"
