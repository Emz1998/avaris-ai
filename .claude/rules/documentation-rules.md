# Documentation Rules

## Core Rules

- No emojis or tables when documenting in a markdown file
- Prefer using lists (bullet points and numbered lists) over paragraphs
- Use bold (\*\*) to highlight titles and important information
- Use italic (\*) for additional/special instructions
- Use code blocks (```) for code snippets
- Use ` ` backticks for inline code snippets and also for some keywords
- Max 2 header levels (#, ##) for headings. Use \*\* for other levels of headings
- Documentation should be high level and concise. Do not bloat it.
- Avoid overexplaining, overengineering and overdocumenting
- Use **Important!** for very important information you want to remember
- Numbering format should be like this:
  1. Info 1
  2. Info 2
  3. Info 3
- Prefer simple and concise natural language over complex and verbose natural language
- Maximum of 250 lines
